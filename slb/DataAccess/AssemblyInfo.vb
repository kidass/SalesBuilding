' General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following 
' set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information

' Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
'
'      Major Version
'      Minor Version 
'      Revision
'      Build Number
'
' You can specify all the values or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers 
' by using the '*' as shown below:
<Assembly: AssemblyVersion("4.0.0.0")> 

'
' In order to sign your assembly you must specify a key to use. Refer to the 
' Microsoft.NET Framework SDK documentation for more information on assembly
' signing.
'
' Use the attributes below to control which key is used for signing. 
'
' Notes: 
'
'   (*) If no key is specified - the assembly cannot be signed.
'   (*) KeyName refers to a key that has been installed in the Crypto Service
'       Provider (CSP) on your machine. 
'   (*) If the key file and a key name attributes are both specified, the 
'       following processing occurs:
'       (1) If the KeyName can be found in the CSP - that key is used.
'       (2) If the KeyName does not exist and the KeyFile does exist, the key 
'           in the file is installed into the CSP and used.
'   (*) Delay Signing is an advanced option - see the Microsoft.NET Framework 
'       SDK documentation for more information on this.
